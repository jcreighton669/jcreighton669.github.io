                I found some other programs and tutorials from the same creator that I used for the simple Python games page, Al Sweigart. For these programs, I used the book
                <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/" target="_blank">Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame</a
                    >
                    because these games use GUI interfaces and because they have
                    a buggy version provided for the reader to recreate the
                    program and test their knowledge of the Python language. Al
                    Sweigart has both the correct version and a bug-riddled
                    version available for the Inkspill (a "Flood It" clone) and
                    Flippy (an "Othello" clone). I initially just wanted to try
                    out the Star Pusher game that was in chapter 9, but once I
                    finished this project, and found some flaws in the code
                    because of updates to the Pygame library not included in the
                    book.

                    The code that is in the version of the book that I was using
                    was interesting and is one of the first games that I coded
                    that use a graphic interface, and the first that uses a
                    predefined map system for each of the 50 levels. The game
                    controls use the arrows to navigate the sprite and the 'a',
                    's', 'd', 'w' keys to pan the map. Other buttons that are
                    used in the game are the 'n' key to move on to the next
                    level, the 'b' key to move back a level and the 'p' key will
                    switch between sprite characters that the player can use.

                    Above is a small snippet of the gameplay from the game
                    including a cycling of the different characters that can be
                    used throughout the game. The characters do not have any
                    special skills during gameplay, just an aesthetic difference
                    between them. The goal in the game is to move the stars to
                    designated blocks to complete each level and go on to the
                    next stage. For my version of the code used in the video,

                    This game uses six different colors that must be matched and
                    eventually must be cleared in the given number of turns. The
                    game also has different leveling systems, including easy,
                    medium, and hard. There are also different sizes that the
                    game board can be. The small game board is a “6x6”, the
                    medium/default game board is a “17x17”, and the large game
                    board is a “30x30”. The initial board has the colors of red,
                    green, blue, yellow, orange, and pink. There are also five
                    different groups of colors that can be picked to use that
                    also change the background of the game.

                <p class="w3-container">
                    The different difficulty ratings change the size of the
                    “splotches” of given colors. Below is a clip of the game
                    being played with the different color options and on
                    different difficulties. The first play-through is the
                    default settings for the game on medium with the medium
                    size. The second is with a different color scheme, easy
                    difficulty, and the largest game board. To win the game, the
                    player must select a color square at the bottom of the
                    screen. The color that is at the top left corner of the game
                    no matter the difficulty or size is the starting point. For

                    The game code from the book online also included a
                    background image and a board that I added the version that I
                    made. The system uses logic that allows the user to play
                    competitively against the computer. The goal of the game is
                    to have the most tiles on the board when the board is
                    filled. The player and the computer have to "enclose" the
                    other player's tiles inside your own to change them from
                    white to black or vice versa. The game ends when the board
                    is full, and the points are allocated by the number of each
                    player's piece on the board earning one point. Throughout
                    the game, the program tracks the score and displays it. The
                    program compares and calculates the point difference between
                    the user and the computer telling the user the winner and
                    the loser. To see the code that I used for this is in my

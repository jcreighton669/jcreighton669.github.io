                    In the summer of 2020, I worked for bioMerieux as the
                    Information Systems Intern for their Global IS team. During
                    this time of COVID-19 in the United States, I worked from
                    home for the entire time. I worked with and interacted with
                    people from all over the globe. I felt that the project
                    managers that I worked for allowed me to work autonomously.
                    There were different topics that I had to learn to succeed
                    in this role. I worked with three distinct groups in the
                    company's IS field. I worked on the company SharePoint site,
                    the telecommunications group on different Cisco devices, and
                    the Service Center observing tickets and identifying trends.

                </div>
                <p class="w3-container">
                    While working for the SharePoint team, I reported to a group
                    in France. I learned more sophisticated Excel functions, how
                    to create and post SharePoint pages, and developed different
                    JavaScript functions. The first product that I built for
                    bioMerieux was a simplified contact support table. The
                    original table included IS support information for each of
                    the countries that bioMerieux operates, about 45, causing
                    users to scroll through the list to find the required
                    information. I created a simple form input section with a
                    submit button and an HTML table.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-container">
                    I also created a JavaScript function that searches the table
                    for a country name entered into the page. When the name is
                    submitted, the row displays the information to the user, and
                    all other countries remain hidden.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-container">
                    The second page helps to maintain device turnover.
                    bioMerieux has employees all over the world, and the app I
                    made allows users to check their devices. The list pulls the
                    data from a JSON file and converts it to an HTML table,
                    similar to the first page. When the page opens, a jQuery
                    function pulls the data from the file and populates a hidden
                    table. Users then input the computer ID into the search bar
                    and click submit. After confirming that the functionality of
                    the pages works, I converted the files to .aspx so that they
                    can be added and moved quickly on the SharePoint site.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-container">
                    The last project that I worked on involved the use of excel
                    spreadsheets. The team manager tasked me with making the
                    multipage workbook to allow data on subsequent pages to be
                    altered with changes to the principal/first page of the
                    file. The information for the spreadsheet is gathered
                    through the use of the Microsoft Forms application.

                    Chronologically, the first project family that I worked on
                    helped to audit the Cisco telecommunication system. I
                    started inspecting by comparing the existing settings of
                    devices around the globe with standardized documentation.
                    There were a few issues and problems with the settings of
                    some conferencing equipment. I tracked and documented the
                    discrepancies in a spreadsheet and turned in my findings to
                    my manager.

                    Following the analysis of the existing infrastructure in
                    place, I worked on creating a product catalog for different
                    Cisco products. The products being researched are part of
                    the

                    family. I read through the manuals of the Room Kit Mini,
                    Standard, Plus, and Pro to find different specifications.

                    Each of the gadgets has its uses and recommended
                    peripherals. I pulled different specifics and standard
                    pieces of data for the catalog. The catalog is to be used
                    for the company members to order/request new equipment from
                    the IS department.

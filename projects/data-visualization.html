                    I was introduced to the Python Programming language after being exposed to C++, Java, and PHP. I really enjoyed the simplicity of the language for a introductory language and it requires a lot less symbols and braces. I was studying Introduction to Computer
                    Programming at Wake Tech in Raleigh, North Carolina and was immediately intrigued because the teacher was more into the programming language than my Java teacher at the time. This made me put forth more effort in learning the language
                    to pass. As I got closer to the end of the semester, I decided to continue learning python on my own and did some research on different books that I could use to teach myself. I knew my skill level wasn't high, so I looked for books
                    that were either geared to beginners that helped to transition intermediate level programmers, and got lucky when I found

                        Since I was shopping and researching online, I was
                        indeed judging a book by its cover, and I am glad that I
                        decided on this book. It starts at the basics for the
                        first eleven chapters to get the reader/coder
                        familiarized with Python and understand the importance
                        of knowing the environment, the language packages, and
                        some of the nuances of Python before going into the
                        three major projects that explain some of the strengths
                        behind Python. The second project section of the book,
                        Data Visualization, was the section that really grabbed
                        my attention and allowed me to do more individual
                        investigation and research into some of the libraries
                        that have been created for Python. The Matplotlib python
                        library is utilized in the creation of the different
                        visuals from the different exercises covered in the
                        book. My favorite three were the Random Walk, Github
                        Analysis chart(s), and the US/World Population graphics.

                        The Random Walk section of the book is used to create
                        random scatter plots or line segments to simulate random
                        movement. The idea is that this type of programming
                        might be able to simulate either molecular movement or
                        the movement of a single speck of pollen on a drop of
                        water or dew. While doing the initial coding of this
                        section, I noticed that there were different aspects of
                        the code that I could alter and personalized. I looked
                        up the documentation for using the Matplotlib library
                        for altering the color spectrum of the different points
                        as well as changing the background from the system
                        default colors.

                    <p class="w3-container">
                        The image below is an example of the alterations that I
                        made by researching through the documentation of
                        Matplotlib by changing the cmap propterty from the
                        default blue color to the "summer" color scheme. In
                        order to alter the background color of the graphs, I
                        found the "set_facecolor" method and used the
                        hexademical value to set the background color to
                        <code>#1f0954</code> the equivalent to
                        <code>darkindigo</code>. A great site that allows for
                        the using a set of colors for the background is on

                        points to escpecially demonstrate the random motion of

                        goes from darker to lighter as the points progress
                        through the program.

                        I created a program that used the concepts discussed in
                        this book as well as other concepts that I researched
                        while creating other applications. This program allows
                        the user to enter an integer value and simulates rolling
                        dice the number of times indicated by the user. Each
                        roll is saved into a list. The list is then analyized
                        for individual count occurences and the count is saved
                        in a list to be used by a function that graphs the
                        results in a horizontal bar graph using the
                        <code>Matplotlib</code> module. The program also uses
                        the <code>random</code> module to roll the dice.

                        I wanted a graphical representation that showed that

                        are equal. The above graph shows a simulation of 100,000
                        rolls and the below graph is a representation of
                        1,000,000 rolls. I designed simulated faces of the die

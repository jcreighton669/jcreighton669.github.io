            <h3>Number Guessing Game</h3>

            <p class="w3-container">
                This is a simple number guessing game that randomly selects an integer number between 1 and 100. The application gives instructions to the player on what to guess and checks the guess before checking the accuracy of the number. If the guess is not valid,
                the guess is ignored and the player is instructed to try again.

            <p class="w3-container">
                In the original version of my game, the player is given 10 chances to guess the number. I enhanced/extended the game to make the user choose the difficulty which will effect the range and the number of guesses allotted to reach the number. In the easy
                setting the user will have to find the correct number between 1 and 20 in 5 attempts. The medium difficulty will be the same as the original version, but the hard difficulty will decrease the number of guesses to 5 for the range that is
                still between 1 and 100.
            </p>

                The program uses the <code>random</code> module as well as the <code>sys</code> module. The random module allows me to generate a random number in the range of the difficulty previously mentioned. The <code>sys</code> module is used to
                change the color of the final message after the game to red so that the user is visually cued that the game is over. I created this program with simple logic commands in and without the use of any methods and functions. The source code
                for these programs can be found on my personal

                    The Tic-Tac-Toe game code is based on the code from

                    This code uses many different methods to get a user to play
                    against a simple computer artificial intelligence. The
                    player first selects their "piece" of either X or O.
                    Randomly, the computer selects whether the user of the
                    computer will go first in making moves. The computer
                    prioritizes taking the corners, then the center unless the
                    computer can win the game.

                    The game uses a simple python list to hold the move choices
                    of both the user and the computer. I added a layout of the
                    spaces at the start of the program so the user knows where
                    the moves will end after each move. After each game, the
                    player is asked if they want to play again.

                <h3>Dragon's Realm</h3>
                <p class="w3-container">
                    Dragon's Realm is another game taht came from Invent Your
                    Own Computer Games with Python. I was interested in this
                    game because it is completely a text-based game that
                    initially made me think of the classic game Zork. This came
                    uses the <code>random</code> module and the
                    <code>time</code> module. The premise of the game is for the
                    user to select between one of two caves to search. Both of
                    the caves have a dragon and a treasure, though in one of
                    them the dragon is benevolent and will gladly give the user
                    the treasure, while the other is a protective dragon that
                    attack the user. The game randomly assigns the good or bad
                    cave. After the user makes a selection, the story will begin
                    with a short break of two seconds between each line of the
                    story to tell the user what fate will befall the adventurer.

                <p class="w3-container">
                    Hangman is a classic game that allows people to solve a
                    simple spelling game that inspired things such as
                    <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>. The game uses a word bank made of
                    types of animals. The game only accepts letters as guesses
                    and checks the guessed letter to see if it has already been
                    guessed. Unoriginal guesses are ignored and the player is
                    informed that the letter has been guessed in a previous
                    round.

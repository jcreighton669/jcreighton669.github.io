                I worked on different methods of creating this application and even in different languages including Java and Visual Basic.NET. I decided to work it out fully in Python recently. I decided not to work on a GUI for this application and make it strictly
                text-based. The code requires the user to input an integer to distinguish the length of the password. After submitting the length, the user is presented with a randomly generated string of characters. The user is then asked if they would
                like to check the strength of the password. If the user decides to check the strength, a new tab opens up to the website
                <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/" target="_blank">How Secure is My Password</a
                    >
                    and the password is added to the clipboard so the user only
                    has to use the keyboard command, <code>Ctrl+V</code>, and
                    the website will give a rough estimate on how long it would
                    take to crack the password.

                    I used Python's random, webbrowser, and pyperclip modules
                    for this application. The random module is used to generate
                    the password from a key of characters the length of the
                    users request. I used the webbrowser module to open a
                    specific website that is designed to check the strength and
                    complexity of a password or string. I found the pyperclip
                    module when researching a way to quickly paste the string
                    into the website but storing the string into the systems
                    clipboard. If this program interests you, visit my

                This program started ou a stand-alone project but was then incorporated into a much larger API being developed by other members of the NCEMC organization. Succeeding on the downloader project led me to be assigned a follow-on project which used the downloaded
                file archive(s) and extracts certain file types from them. I worked with outside software to decrypt the archive file and different software to read through the archive directories and obtain the proper records. The data that I was working
                with allowed for the data analysts to better track energy consumption and dispersal throughout the NCEMC member cooperatives and helped to lower costs for residents and local businesses.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-container">
                My third primary project task was to create an add-on program that would allow for NCEMC to collect extra information provided by their customers in a fast method using the SQL BulkCopy feature in the .NET framework. I was able to take the structure of
                the existing code and manipulate it to place the information in a specific database. This program allowed/forced me to work with regular expressions and get better at string manipulation. There are plenty of online resources that helped
                me to understand the structure better and use it for regular expressions. The bonus of using the SQL Bulk Copy is the amount of time saved by the system. The process with only about 100 lines of data not using the SQL BilkCopy process
                was longer than the SQL BulkCopy method, processing over 220000 lines of data by more than 3 minutes. The major drawback of using the BulkCopy method for Microsoft SQL Server was the inability to convert data from Strings to ints or other
                numeric types.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-container">
                The fourth and final project that I worked on allowed me to work on many different aspects of automating the ability to analyze weather forecasting data to pricing the solar energy added to the grid. I was able to use another established program/snippet
                to access a designated email account/address and filter through by subject line. The next step was to download an email attachment connected to the email and parse string by line to add to the database table. If the date had already past,
                the lines wouldn't be updated, but all others updated/added. I managed to get the values added to the database table but wanted to make sure that the analysts had an easier time working with the numbers and take a step out of their process
                by converting the string to floating-point numbers.

        I was introduced to the Python Programming language after being exposed
        to C++, Java, and PHP. I enjoyed the simplicity of the language for an
        introductory language, and it requires fewer symbols and braces. I
        studied Introduction to Computer Programming at Wake Tech in Raleigh,
        North Carolina. I was immediately intrigued because the teacher was more
        into the programming language than my Java teacher at the time. The
        teacher's enthusiasm made me put forth more effort in learning the
        language to pass. As I got closer to the end of the semester, I decided
        to continue learning Python on my own and did some research on different
        books that I could use to teach myself. I knew my skill level wasn't
        high, so I looked for books geared to beginners that helped to
        transition intermediate level programmers, and got lucky when I found
        <em
          >Crash Course Python: A Hands-on Project-Based Introduction to
          Programming</em
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="container">
        Since I was shopping and researching online, I was judging a book by its
        cover, and I am glad that I decided on this book. It starts at the
        basics for the first eleven chapters to get the reader/coder
        familiarized with Python and understand the importance of knowing the
        environment, the language packages, and some of Python's nuances before
        going into the three major projects that explain some of the strengths
        behind Python. The second project section of the book, Data
        Visualization, was the section that grabbed my attention and allowed me
        to do more personal investigation and research into some of the
        libraries that have been created for Python. The Matplotlib python
        library is utilized to develop the different visuals from the various
        exercises covered in the book. My favorite three were the Random Walk,
        Github Analysis chart(s), and the US/World Population graphics.

      <p class="display-4 text-center">Random Walks</p>
      <p class="container">
        The Random Walk section of the book is used to create random scatter
        plots or line segments to simulate spontaneous movement. The idea is
        that this type of programming might be able to simulate either molecular
        movement or the movement of a single speck of pollen on a drop of water
        or dew. While doing the initial coding of this section, I noticed
        different aspects of the code that I could alter and personalized. I
        looked up the documentation for using the Matplotlib library to adjust
        the color spectrum of the various points and change the background from
        the system default colors.
      </p>
      <p class="container">
        The image below is an example of the alterations that I made by
        researching through the documentation of Matplotlib by changing the cmap
        property from the default blue color to the "summer" color scheme. To
        alter the graphs' background color, I found the "set_facecolor" method
        and used the hexadecimal value to set the background color to
        <code>#1f0954</code> , the equivalent to <code>dark indigo</code>. A
        great site that allows for the using a set of colors for the background
        is on

        >. I left in the indicators for the first and last plot points to
        demonstrate the points' random motion. The change in shade and hue of
        the points goes from darker to lighter as the program progresses.

      <p class="display-4 text-center">Rolling Dice</p>
      <p>
        I created a program that used the concepts discussed in this book and
        other concepts that I researched while creating other applications. This
        program allows the user to enter an integer value and simulates rolling
        dice the user's number of times. Each roll is saved into a list. The
        list is then analyzed for individual count occurrences, and the count is
        kept in an array to be used by a function that graphs the results in a
        horizontal bar graph using the <code>Matplotlib</code> module. The
        program also uses the <code>random</code> module to roll the dice.

        I wanted a graphical representation that showed that the odds of getting
        any given side are equal with enough trials. The above graph shows a
        simulation of 100,000 rolls, and the below chart is a representation of
        1,000,000 rolls. I designed simulated faces of the die to be the
        representation on the graph for ease of viewing.

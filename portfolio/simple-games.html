      <p class="container">
        This game is a simple number guesser that randomly selects an integer
        number between 1 and 100. The application gives the player instructions
        on what to guess and checks the guess before checking the accuracy of
        the number. If the guess is not valid, the guess is ignored, and the
        player is instructed to try again.
      </p>

        />
      </div>
      <p class="container">
        In the original version of my game, the player is given ten chances to
        guess the number. I enhanced/extended the game to make the user choose
        the difficulty, which will affect the range and the number of guesses
        allotted to reach the number. The user will have to find the correct
        number between 1 and 20 in 5 attempts on the easy setting. The medium
        difficulty will be the same as the original version, but the hard
        difficulty will decrease the number of guesses to 5 for the range
        between 1 and 100.

        The program uses the <code>random</code> module as well as the
        <code>sys</code> module. The random module allows me to generate a
        random number in the range of the difficulty previously mentioned. The
        <code>sys</code> module is used to change the final message's color to
        red, so the user is visually cued that the game is over. I created this
        program with simple logic commands in and without the use of any methods
        and functions. These programs' source code can be found my personal

      <h2 class="display-6">Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
      <p class="container">
        The Tic-Tac-Toe game code is based on the code from
        <a
          href="http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter10.html#"
          class="link-dark"
          target="_blank"
          >Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python</a
        >. This code uses many different methods to get a user to play against a
        simple computer artificial intelligence. The player first selects their
        "piece" of either X or O. The computer decides whether the computer or
        the user will go first in making moves. The computer prioritizes taking
        the corners, then the center unless the computer can win the game.
      </p>

        />
      </div>
      <p class="container">
        The game uses a simple python list to hold both the user and the
        computer's move choices. I added a layout of the spaces at the start of
        the program to help the user. After each game, the player is asked if
        they want to play again.

      <h2 class="display-6">Dragon's Realm</h2>
      <p class="container">
        Dragon's Realm is another game that came from Invent Your Own Computer
        Games with Python. I was interested in this game because it is entirely
        a text-based game that initially made me think of Zork's classic
        gameplay. The game uses the <code>random</code> module and the
        <code>time</code> module. The premise of the game is for the user to
        select between one of two caves to search. Both of the caves have a
        dragon and a treasure, but the dragon is benevolent and will gladly give
        the user the prize, while the other is a protective dragon that attacks
        the user. The game randomly assigns the positive or negative cave. After
        the user makes a selection, the story will begin with a short break of
        two seconds between each storyline to tell the user what fate will
        befall the adventurer.

      <h2 class="display-6">Hangman</h2>
      <p class="container">
        Hangman is a classic game that allows people to solve a simple spelling
        game that inspired things such as
        <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>. The game uses a word bank made of types of
        animals. The game only accepts letters as guesses and checks the guessed
        letter to see if it has already been guessed. Unoriginal guesses are
        ignored, and the player is informed that the letter has been guessed in
        a previous round.

                    After I graduated, I spent a couple years in the
                    food-service industry in my hometown as well as the manager
                    of the Concessions for the local summer collegiate baseball
                    team. In 2010, I enlisted in the United States Army. While
                    in the military, I studied Arabic, in addition to training
                    as a Human Intelligence Collector. After the military, I
                    separated with an Honorable Discharge. I want to use the
                    skills that I gain to help motivate and encourage others to
                    enter into the STEM field, especially minorities and those
                    under-represented in the market today.

                                From March 2011 to December 2012, I studied
                                Standard Arabic while serving in the United
                                States Army. Studying Arabic required learning
                                the alphabet and the different forms of the
                                characters. I learned under the guidance of
                                native speakers from Middle East and Northern
                                African countries. I learned to read, write, and
                                speak in the language.

                                on from start to finish. The first project

                                second project in the book has been the most
                                compelling and easy to follow of the three. It
                                was smaller than the other two major projects.
                                This project uses Matplotlib to display either
                                scatter plots, bar graphs, and other visuals for
                                data anaysis. The programs in this section can
                                be used to simulate the movement of a speck of
                                pollen on a drop of water.

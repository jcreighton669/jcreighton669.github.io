                I assisted in the development of in-house
                applications using
                <strong>VB.Net and C#.Net framework</strong>. In

                <strong>Microsoft SQL Server, Stored procedures,

                throughout the summer internship. I was allowed
                to use and research of third party software to
                complete development tasks. I worked on data

                I trained in different techniques to become a
                Human Intelligence Collector. Training involved
                screening, tactical questioning and mock
                interrogations. I developed my active listening
                and effective communication skills. Another
                emphasis for training was on proper report
                writing with a focus on being brief. These
                skills have helped me throughout my work in the
                military as well as in civilian work. Essential
                Skills:

                From March 2011 to December 2012, I studied
                Standard Arabic while serving in the United
                States Army. Studying Arabic required learning
                the alphabet and the different forms of the
                characters. I learned under the guidance of
                native speakers from Middle East and Northern
                African countries. I learned to read, write, and
                speak in the language.

                the United States, I worked from home for the
                entire time. I worked with and interacted with
                people from all over the globe. I felt that the
                project managers that I worked for allowed me to
                work autonomously. There were different topics
                that I had to learn to succeed in this role. I
                worked with three distinct groups in the
                company's IS field. I worked on the company
                SharePoint site, the telecommunications group on
                different Cisco devices, and the Service Center

                major projects and three programs that I worked
                on from start to finish. The first project
                involved working with the updated standards of
                the data retrieval from the Ecobee API system.
                The second one involved using the sql bulk copy

                from smart meter technology.

                compelling and easy to follow of the three. It
                was smaller than the other two major projects.
                This project uses Matplotlib to display either
                scatter plots, bar graphs, and other visuals for
